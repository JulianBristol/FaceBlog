            "You ever seen that part in a movie when the guy is soaked to the bone in the rain, confessing to the girl about how much he loves her? Yeah, that’s me and programming.",
            "I started out with Java, OOP-ing it out (sick programmer slang), and cuz your boy don’t cheat, I didn’t want anything to do with front-end development.",
            "However, I had to start my internship at a startup called Lykka Village. I’ve never had an internship before, but this was less like an internship and more like being thrown to the wolves. In a good way, I swear!",
            "I see it as that movie troupe when they lock someone up in the dungeon with monsters and 3 weeks later, they open it up to find the monsters completely tamed.",
            "They told us what the stakeholders wanted and we were left to figure it out. All of a sudden, all my courses in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 became relevant. The problem was, they wanted us to use React.js and Material-UI. Cue the lightning and thunder.",
            "Cause I didn’t really know what I was doing, I did one little React.js MERN stack tutorial and a quick MUI tutorial and I was hooked on component-based architecture. From the get go, we were learning about RESTful APIs, UI/UX design, responsive web design, and version control/Git. I then had the realization that this was the backbone of every project that I have ever seen. At some point, my classmates started coming to me for help and I was guiding their projects.",
            "By the time the internship at Lykka ended, I had the cofounder, Jean-Michel Pollak, saying “His attention to detail, rigour and obvious desire to do what is best for the project always shines”. That’s seriously in his letter of reference.",
            "I enjoyed my time there so much that they extended my internship to a temporary full-time position. During that time, I further learned about performance optimization, debugging, and web accessibility.",
            "Unfortunately, all things must come to an end; Lykka and I had to part ways. Since then, I’ve been working with Searcy Water Utilities to revamp their website and add other backend functionality. I learned a little about SEO best practices during that time and what it is like being the main/only web designer and front-end developer on a project. Its kind of lonely :/",
            "So back to the movie – it’s raining. \"I am just a front-end developer, standing in front of a recruiter/person reading my LinkedIn summary, asking them to love this metaphorical puppy in the rain-soaked cardboard box\".",

            "Passionate and results-driven professional with a diverse background in transportation security and software development. I bring a unique perspective and a strong commitment to excellence in every endeavor. Dedicated to continuously expanding my skills and knowledge to drive innovative solutions in the technology field.",
            "What sparked my interest in software development and led me to pursue a specialization in this field is my long-standing dream to have the knowledge and ability to manipulate computers using programming. This passion has been a driving force behind my pursuit of a bachelor's degree in Information Technology with a specialization in software development.",
            "My experience as a transportation security officer with TSA has significantly contributed to my growth and development as a professional. It taught me the importance of teamwork and how a well-functioning team can move mountains. This experience has instilled in me a dedication to ensuring seamless human-to-human connections in all my endeavors.",
            "During my studies and professional career, a significant project that had a profound impact on my skills and knowledge in software development was an internship turned temporary job position. It introduced me to the world of React and JavaScript, opening my eyes to new programming languages and igniting my love for continuous learning. I believe that in the ever-evolving world of technology, there will always be new things to explore and discover.",
            "To stay up-to-date with the latest advancements and trends in the technology industry, I actively engage in reading news articles, such as Tech Brew, to stay informed. Additionally, I enjoy following tutorials on YouTube to build new projects, which not only keeps me updated but also allows me to practice and enhance my skills.",
            "In the software development field, I am motivated by the challenges and problems that need to be solved. Building websites and programming them is not only a professional pursuit but also an entertaining and leisurely activity for me. When faced with difficult problems, I approach them with an educated guess as a first step. If that doesn't work, I use console logs to debug and analyze the issue. If further assistance is needed, I turn to the internet for similar problems and also rely on my network of friends and coworkers for support and guidance."
